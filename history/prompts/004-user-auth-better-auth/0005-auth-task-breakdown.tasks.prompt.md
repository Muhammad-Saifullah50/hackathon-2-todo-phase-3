# RESPONSE

I have generated an actionable, dependency-ordered `tasks.md` for the User Authentication feature.

**Key Summary:**
- **Total Task Count**: 30
- **User Story 1 (Signup/Login)**: 5 tasks
- **User Story 2 (JWT API)**: 6 tasks
- **User Story 3 (Session/Middleware)**: 4 tasks
- **Parallel Opportunities**: Setup, UI page creation, and concurrent backend/frontend integration.
- **MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 (Setup, Foundation, and Basic Signup/Login).
- **Format Validation**: All tasks strictly follow the `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description` format with explicit file paths.

The task list provides a clear roadmap for implementing Better Auth with FastAPI, ensuring secure data isolation and a seamless user experience.
