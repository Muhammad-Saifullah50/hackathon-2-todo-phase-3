# RESPONSE

Finalized the User Authentication specification after several iterations regarding the Email OTP feature.
- User initially requested basic auth.
- I suggested Email OTP via Better Auth plugin (console logging for dev).
- User ultimately decided to **skip the OTP** for now.
- The specification was updated to focus on basic email/password signup/login with JWT integration for the FastAPI backend.
- All 5 structured clarification questions were answered and integrated.
- Checklist validated and passed.
- Feature is ready for technical planning.
